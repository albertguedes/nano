# NANO PROJECT

This is a project to practice skills in html, css and php in its purest form.
Here I established some rules, which I called _ 'nano philosophy'_:

## NANO PHILOSOPHY

1. each page must function autonomously, that is, a page has no dependence on any external code. 
   The goal is to program a page with all the code in mind, without sharing your attention with 
   other codes.

2. the visual is done without classes or ids, with the aim of focusing your attention only on 
   where and what data and should show. But everyone likes a nice look, so I developed the css 
   framework 'nano.css' to style and make the pages less ugly.

3. the programming is procedural / functional, as it works with oriented objects and its classes 
   try to use inclusion files. Procedural / functional programming attacks what we want right 
   away.

4. The modules fo the project follow the same philosophy of independency. They depend of database
   or session data, but never depend of other modules or apps.


## NOTES

- This project dont ain to be a production app, only for training and pratice.
- Any package has security implementation ( like sql injection, xss, csrf, passwords are encripted with MD5 hash only, etc ).
- Of course, you can freely use this project as a base for your own project, but I am not 
  responsible for any problem caused by the use of third parties.
